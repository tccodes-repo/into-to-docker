## Getting Started

### Hello World

As with any new development technology Docker has a `hello-world` image you can use to 
make sure your [Docker] environment is setup correctly.  

Run the following command

```
docker run hello-world
```

You should see the following output:

```
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
1b930d010525: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:4df8ca8a7e309c256d60d7971ea14c27672fc0d10c5f303856d7bc48f8cc17ff
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

### Examine the `docker` command

The [docker cli] is the main application for creating, managing, and distributing
[Docker] containers.

The [docker cli] has many sub commands that make it very powerful.  We will not cover 
all of the commands in this lesson.  

To see the full list of possible commands run:

```
docker
```

Output:
```

Usage:	docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND

A self-sufficient runtime for containers

Options:
      --config string      Location of client config files (default
                           "/Users/derek/.docker")
  -c, --context string     Name of the context to use to connect to
                           the daemon (overrides DOCKER_HOST env var
                           and default context set with "docker
                           context use")
  -D, --debug              Enable debug mode
  -H, --host list          Daemon socket(s) to connect to
  -l, --log-level string   Set the logging level
                           ("debug"|"info"|"warn"|"error"|"fatal")
                           (default "info")
      --tls                Use TLS; implied by --tlsverify
      --tlscacert string   Trust certs signed only by this CA (default
                           "/Users/derek/.docker/ca.pem")
      --tlscert string     Path to TLS certificate file (default
                           "/Users/derek/.docker/cert.pem")
      --tlskey string      Path to TLS key file (default
                           "/Users/derek/.docker/key.pem")
      --tlsverify          Use TLS and verify the remote
  -v, --version            Print version information and quit
